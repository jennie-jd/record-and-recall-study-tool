# record-and-recall-study-tool

A mini application to record self study questions and practice the questions later.

Question reviews are based on the age of the questions and previous attempts of answering the questions.
- When a question is older, it appears less frequently in the future
- When a question has been answered correctly, the question appears less frequently in the future
